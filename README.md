# NYCrashReports2021

The dataset is publicly available on the Data.org website. https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-person

The Motor Vehicle Collisions person table contains details for people involved in the crash. 
Each row represents a person (driver, occupant, pedestrian, bicyclist,..) involved in a crash. 
The data in this table goes back to April 2016 when crash reporting switched to an electronic system (Motor Vehicle Collisions - Person - CKAN, 2021).

The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police-reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. 
The police report (MV104-AN) must be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage.
The dataset is considered big data since it holds more than 1 million rows and 21 columns.
The easiest way to analyze the data is to use a dataset sample, but using the entire dataset after cleaning might give more accurate results and insights.
The New York City police department collected the data with the help of a program called Trafficstat.

Another evidence that more males, about 66% of the total population, were victims of the accidents in New York City, where only 33% were females.

•	The Top graph reveals a higher percentage between the ages 20 and 40.
•	As probably most researchers would expect, the lowest accident was among persons below 20 years old.
•	A higher percentage of male victims also appears in the table, and the chart supports that finding visually.
